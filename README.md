# Data-driven model development for microstructure description

This notebook presents a toy model Convolutional Neural network example to predict classes of microstructure composed of two materials with different concentrations. 

To run this colab notebook

1. Dowload the zip and polymesh files
2. Open the `class_1.ipynb` in google colab
3. Load the microstructures images in the step 1 of the notebook.
